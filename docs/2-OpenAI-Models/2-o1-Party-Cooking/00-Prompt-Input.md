!!! info "Things to Keep In Mind"

    - Has lots of structured and unstructured data
    - Requires capacity planning but recipes numbers vary
    - Requires schedule planning taking multiple items into account
    - Requires nutritional planning for guests

I am throwing a dinner party for 6 guests at 7pm. 
I want each guest to have 1 serving of the Papri Chaat, 1 serving of the Biryani and 2 servings of the Besan Laddu. Each of the recipes gives the number of servings with detailed instructions and the nutritional value of the recipe.

Use this information to plan my day.

1. Rewrite the recipes to fit the number of people and servings I need. Keep the recipes short and focused.
1. Study the time taken for the recipes and plan out how I should cook all the dishes so they are ready by 6pm. Give me a detailed schedule which tells me the time to start prep work, time to complete cooking, and leave 30 mins at the end for cleanup.
1. Use the nutritional information to estimate the nutritional intake for each guest given the servings they are allocated
1. Review the recipe and add a warning label at the bottom of this plan indicating which recipes have potential allergens including dairy, nuts, and seafood.

18 to 20 garlic cloves - medium to large sized
2 teaspoons kashmiri red chilli powder
¼ teaspoon salt or add as required
2 to 3 tablespoons water or add as required, for blending or grinding
Instructions
Cooking the chickpeas
If you wanna add chickpeas to the papdi chaat, then some effort is needed. This is if you don't want to use canned chickpeas.
Rinse chickpeas in water a couple of times. Soak them in 3 cups water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.
Later drain the soaked water and rinse the chickpeas again a few time. Add the chickpeas to a 2 litre pressure cooker together with water and salt.
If you want to cook potato, then keep a potato in steel bowl. Place this steel bowl with the potato in it on the chickpeas and water mixture in the cooker. The potato and chickpeas will be cooked together.
Cover the cooker tightly with the lid and pressure cook on medium heat until the pressure starts building and you hear the hissing sound in the cooker. Then lower the heat a bit and pressure cook for 10 to 12 whistles.
When the pressure settles on its own in the cooker then only remove the lid.
Check the potato by piercing it with a knife or fork. It should be tender, soft and the knife or fork should easily pass through it. Lift the potato with a pasta tong and set it aside to cool at room temperature.
Check to see if the chickpeas are cooked. They should have a soft melt-in-the-mouth texture. Drain the water and set the cooked chickpeas aside.
Making the green mint coriander chutney
Blend all the ingredients with very little water to a smooth and fine consistency.
Set aside or refrigerate in a small covered container or jar.
Making the sweet tamarind dates chutney
Boil the tamarind and dates in water.
When they become soft add the jaggery and the spice powders and salt.
Cook further till the jaggery melts.
Switch off the heat and let the mixture cool.
Grind the chutney mixture to a fine and smooth paste. Seive the chutney through a strainer if needed. Add more salt if required.
If the chutney becomes too thick add some water to liquidize it.
Making spicy chili garlic chutney
Peel the garlic cloves and rinse them in water. Add them together with the kashmiri red chilli powder, salt and water to a small blender or chutney grinder jar or a spice grinder.
Blend to a smooth and fine consistency without any tiny chunks or bits.
Transfer the red chutney in a small bowl and set aside.
For assembling papdi chaat
Arrange 6 to 8 papdi in a shallow bowl or plate.
Top it up with some of the chopped boiled potato cubes and cooked chickpeas.
You can add chopped onions and tomatoes at this point, but it is optional.
Sprinkle some chaat masala, roasted cumin powder and optionally kashmiri red chili powder on it, if you want at this step.
Top these with whisked cold curd (yogurt) as you like.
Top it up evenly with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the green chutney as much as you want.
Then add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the sweet tamarind chutney and 1 to 2 teaspoons of the spicy chilli garlic chutney evenly. According to your taste preferences you can add less or more of each chutney.
Sprinkle some chaat masala, red chili powder, cumin powder and black salt or regular salt.
Garnish with coriander leaves and pomegranate arils. Sprinkle sev on top and this step is also optional.
Add a dash of lemon juice to the papri chaat if you prefer.
Serve papdi chaat immediately.
Notes
Swap about 2.5 to 3 cups canned chickpeas or cooked chickpeas with dried chickpeas. Drain the liquids of the canned chickpeas, rinse them and then add to the chaat. 
You can omit making the spicy and pungent chilli garlic chutney. But do make the green chutney and tamarind chutney for the chaat. 
Personalize and customize the chaat according to your likings and taste preferences. Example add more sweet chutney if you prefer a more sweeter taste in your chaat.
The chutneys can be prepped a day ahead and refrigerated in small covered containers or jars. 
You can halve the recipes of the various chutneys. The leftover green chutney keeps well for a couple of days in the refrigerator. The tamarind chutney keeps well for a few weeks in the fridge. 
For the papdi, make them yourself or if you have time or purchase from stores or shops. 
The recipe can be scaled to make a small batch or a large batch for parties or potlucks.

⅓ cup chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) - 20 grams
⅓ cup chopped mint leaves - 5 grams
4 to 5 tablespoons milk
¼ teaspoon saffron strands
2 teaspoons kewra water (pandanus water) or rose water
Instructions
Soaking rice
Pick and rinse basmati rice in running water till the water runs clear of starch. Soak the rice in 1 cup of water for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes drain the rice and set aside.
When the rice is soaking prep all the veggies and other ingredients. Set aside.
Cooking rice
Take a deep bottomed pan. Add water and heat the water on a high flame.
When the water becomes hot, add the salt and following spices: tej patta, green cardamoms, cloves, black cardamom, cinnamon, strands of mace.
Bring the water to a boil. Then add the soaked basmati rice.
Just gently stir with a spoon or fork, after you add the soaked rice.
Do not reduce the flame and continue to cook the rice grains.
The rice has to be ¾ᵗʰ cooked. The grains should have a slight bite to them when cooked. The rice should not be fully cooked.
Drain the rice in a colander. Gently fluff and keep aside.
Making vegetable curry/gravy
In a 2-litre pressure cooker or a pan, heat ghee. Add the following spices - shahjeera, tej patta, green cardamoms, cloves, black cardamom and cinnamon. Sauté the whole spices till they crackle.
Now add the onions. Stir and sauté them on a low to medium flame.
Add a pinch of salt to quicken the cooking process.
When the onions are cooking, take 1 cup fresh curd (yogurt) in a bowl and whisk the curd with a spoon or wired whisk till it become smooth.
Sauté the onions till they become golden brown or caramelize.
Then add the ginger-garlic paste and sliced green chillies. You can also finely chop the ginger-garlic and add.
Sauté till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.
Add the turmeric and red chili powder. Stir and mix well.
Next add the chopped veggies. Sauté for a minute or two.
Lower the heat and add the whisked curd (yogurt). Stir and mix well as soon as you add the curd. Then add ½ cup water in the pressure cooker. For cooking in a pan, add ¾ cup water.
Season with salt and mix again.
Pressure cook for 1 whistle on 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat. If cooking in a pot, then cook until the vegetables are tender. Don’t over cook the vegetables.
Warm 4 to 5 tablespoons milk in a microwave or in a small pan on the stove top. Add ¼ teaspoon of saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.
When the pressure settles down on its own, remove the lid and check the gravy.
If the vegetables are under cooked, then keep the cooker on the stove top and simmer the veg biryani gravy without the lid, till the vegetables are tender.
If there is too much of water or stock in the gravy, then simmer until some of the water evaporates and dries up. Note that the vegetable gravy should have a medium or slightly thick consistency and should not be watery.
Now add cashews, raisins and almonds (blanched or raw) to the vegetable gravy. Mix and stir. Set aside. Do a taste test and check the salt in the vegetable gravy. Add more if needed.
Assembling and layering
Now in a thick bottomed pan, layer half portion of the vegetable gravy first.
Then layer half portion of the semi-cooked rice.
Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander leaves (cilantro), mint leaves and saffron milk.
Layer the remaining vegetable gravy.
Layer the last portion of the rice. Sprinkle the remaining coriander leaves, mint leaves, and saffron infused milk on the top. Sprinkle rose water or kewra water.
You can make 2 layers or 4 layers like I have done. But do note that rice should be the top layer and the vegetable gravy should be the bottom layer.
Dum cooking
Now seal and secure the pot with an aluminium foil. Then cover with a lid. You can also seal the pan with a moist cotton cloth and then cover with a lid.
Take a tava/griddle/skillet and heat it on medium flame.
When the tawa become hot, then lower the flame. Keep the sealed veg biryani pan on the tawa.
Keep the flame to the lowest and cook for 30 to 35 minutes. You can dum cook hyderabadi veg biryani for the first 15 minutes on a direct low flame and then for the last 10 minutes, place the pan on the hot tawa/skillet and cook on a low heat.
Once done using a fork or spoon check the bottom layer of the biryani. There should be no liquids at the bottom. If there are liquids, then continue to dum cook for some more time.
After dum cooking, give a resting time of 5 to 7 minutes and later serve the hyderabadi veg biryani. 
Serving Suggestions
While serving, make sure you equally serve the vegetables as well as the rice.
There are various sides that pair best with a veg biryani. Biryani is usually accompanied with a raita (yogurt dip). You can choose to pair it with Cucumber Raita, Onion Tomato Raita and Boondi Raita, or you could enjoy biryani with any savory raita of your liking.
You can also pair it with Kachumber Salad (onion-tomato salad), plain Curd (Yogurt), Mango Pickle, some lemon wedges or roasted papad.
The hyderabadi veg biryani is usually served with Mirchi ka Salan (Green Chilly Curry) and raita. If desired you can serve biryani with a simple soupy Shorba gravy.
You can also enjoy biryani as it is without any sides or accompaniments.
Storage
Store the biryani leftovers in your refrigerator for a day only. While reheating steam for 5 minutes in a pan or Instant pot. You could even lightly sauté the biryani stirring frequently in a frying pan or skillet until warm or hot.
Notes
For Baking Veg Biryani
You could also preheat the oven to 180 degree Celsius/356 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes and bake the veg biryani in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes.
Remember to use an oven safe glass bowl or casserole dish like the pyrex bowl or use a dutch oven.
You have to assemble the veg biryani as mentioned above in the casserole dish or your dutch oven. Seal tightly with aluminium foil or an oven safe heat resistant lid and then bake.
 
Recipe Notes and Variations
Ingredients: Do try to use all the ingredients as mentioned in the recipe.
Rice:  Use a good quality basmati rice – preferably aged basmati rice. You can even use Sella Basmati Rice which is parboiled basmati rice (known as sella basmati rice in Hindi and converted basmati rice outside India). For sella basmati rice, you will need to soak the rice grains for an hour. The cooking time will also increase for this variety of basmati rice.
Cooking of rice: Cook the rice grains till they are ¾ᵗʰ done. They will have a slight bite to them and will be slightly undercooked. Do not cook the rice all the way as they will become mushy by the time the biryani is dum cooked. 
Spices: The lovely fragrance and aroma in a biryani comes from using whole spices. Thus the spices need to be fresh and in their shelf life. 
Curd (Yogurt): Use fresh yogurt that is slightly sweet and not sour. The curd or yogurt should also be made from whole milk. Do not use fat-free yogurt or curd made from toned milk as it will split while cooking.
Biryani gravy: The curry or gravy for the biryani should have a medium to medium-thick consistency. It should not be watery like a stock or broth as this will lead to the rice becoming mushy or very soft after dum cooking.
Vegan variation: Use almond milk yogurt or cashew milk yogurt. Replace ghee (clarified butter) with oil. You could use any vegetable oil or neutral tasting oil.

Recipe 3: Besan Laddu

Easy Besan ke Laddu Recipe

5minutes mins
Cook Time
25minutes mins
Total Time
30minutes mins
Course: SweetsCuisine: North IndianDiet: Gluten Free, VegetarianDifficulty Level: Moderate Servings: 15 besan ladoo Calories: 155kcal Author: Dassana Amit
Ingredients
2 cups gram flour (besan) - 200 grams
½ cup Ghee (clarified butter) - 125 grams, add more ghee, if required
1 cup powdered sugar (heaped) or boora or castor sugar or confectioner's sugar - 175 grams (powder ¾ cup white sugar or raw sugar in a mixer-grinder, small blender)
1 teaspoon cardamom powder or 5 to 6 green cardamoms, powdered in a mortar-pestle
1 to 2 tablespoons golden raisins - chopped
10 to 12 cashews - finely chopped
Instructions
Roasting besan
Dry roast the besan in a heavy kadai or pan on low to medium-low heat for about 10 to 12 minutes.
Keep on stirring continuously right from the beginning. So that the besan is not burned and cooks evenly.
Adding ghee and roasting further
After 12 minutes of total roasting time, add the ghee.
Mix very well and continue roasting the besan for some more 12 to 15 minutes stirring non-stop.
You will see that the mixture will start releasing ghee and will give a nice fragrant nutty aroma.
Some ghee will float on top and and you will see a molten lava kind of consistency where the ghee is floating. 
The mixture will also loose sides of the pan and become one. These are the signs that the besan is fully cooked.
Once you see these signs, you can move on to the next step.
Remove the pan from the stove-top and place it on your kitchen countertop. Add powdered sugar.
Adding powdered sugar
Begin to mix with all the strength from your hands. You have to mix this part vigorously so that the powdered sugar melts in the roasted besan and ghee mixture and no lumps are formed.
Add the powdered cardamom, raisins and cashews. Mix again.
Once you have mixed the ladoo mixture well then let it become lukewarm or cool at room temperature.
Making besan ladoo
When cooled, make small or medium-sized besan ladoo and store them in an airtight steel container.
If you are not able to shape in balls then freeze the mixture for 5 minutes or refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Depending on the quality and consistency of ghee as well as the room temperature you may be able to easily shape these or not.
Serve besan ladoo garnished with some nuts.
Storage
Besan laddu keeps well at room temperature for a month. Keep in a clean covered jar or container in a cool dry place. You can use a steel jar.
You can refrigerate these. But on refrigerating the ghee in the laddu solidifies making them dense or hard. So before serving, let them thaw completely.
Notes
Besan: You can use both the finer variety of besan or the coarser textured besan. Just ensure that the besan is fresh and has not gone rancid.
Roasting: The besan has to be roasted very well so that it starts releasing ghee and gives a nutty fragrance. Roast the gram flour on low to medium-low heat and keep on stirring non-stop. Depending on the pan thickness, size and intensity of flame, the time of roasting will differ.
Sugar: The sugar that is traditionally added is called as"boora" or "bura" in Hindi. Boora is basically ground unrefined sugar. It is made with sugar which is not processed or bleached, but nowadays you do get boora made with refined sugar in the Indian markets. You can even add powdered sugar or castor sugar or confectioner's sugar. Most of the times I powder raw sugar in a mixer and add. With castor sugar or powdered white sugar the taste is different as some companies add cornstarch in them.
Adding sugar: If you add sugar into the gram flour before it is roasted well, then the uncooked gram flour will have a raw taste in the finished ladoo and you won’t get the perfect sweet taste. Also, once you add the sugar then stir continuously so that no lumps are formed.
Shaping: If you are unable to form the besan ladoo once the mixture has cooled completely, then keep the mixture in the fridge for 20 minutes. The ghee will solidify a bit and you will easily be able to form the ladoo. If the mixture looks to dry or hard, then add 2 to 3 tablespoon of hot melted ghee and mix again. Let the mixture cool again and then shape into laddu. 
Scaling: You can easily double or triple this recipe and store the extra laddu in an airtight steel container for a quick and easy snack or dessert all week.
Nuts & Dry fruits: You can add nuts like almonds, pistachios, pecans, walnuts and pecans. You can even add a pinch of saffron strands. 
Note that the approximate nutrition values is for 1 besan laddu.
