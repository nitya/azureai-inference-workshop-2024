What is this API?","text":"<p>From the Docs</p> <p>The Azure AI Model Inference is an API that exposes a common set of capabilities for foundational models and that can be used by developers to consume predictions from a diverse set of models in a uniform and consistent way. Developers can talk with different models deployed in Azure AI Studio without changing their underlying code!</p> <p>Another way to think about it is that it is a model wrapper that abstracts frequently-used model capabilities into a common API that applications can interact with, for a consistent developer experience, independent of the specific model implementing them.</p> <ul> <li>It throws exceptions cleanly if the underlying model lacks a specific API feature.</li> <li>It supports extensibility by \"passing through\" custom parameters for model-unique features.</li> </ul> <p>This allows us to explore model choice with the same codebase, simply by swapping the model deployment details in the configuration or environment - without changing the application code. We can also compare models side-by-side, by running the same code in different terminals, to contrast quality of responses or performance of execution.</p>"},{"location":"1-Introduction/#2-why-should-we-use-it","title":"2. Why should we use it?","text":"<p>Building generative AI applications requires rapid prototyping and ideation, with the ability to make decisions like model selection, model configuration, prompt template design and orchestration framework in a flexible way. The API provides an abstraction layer between application code and model invocation interface, allowing us to evolve each side independently. This lets us do the following:</p> <ol> <li>Rapid Ideation - Quickly prototype against the API, then explore diverse models for best fit.</li> <li>Design Flexibility - Build for common capabilities, and extend to custom features if present.</li> <li>Deploy Flexibility - Works with Managed Compute and Serverless API model deployments.</li> <li>Ecosystem Expansion - Growing partner list e.g, GitHub Marketplace Models, LlamaIndex.</li> <li>Prompty Enabled - Prompt asset &amp; runtime for rapid prototyping, works out-of-the-box.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"1-Introduction/#3-where-could-we-use-it","title":"3. Where could we use it?","text":"<p>Use it in any situation where you think model choice matters. For instance, \"you have a specific cost or performance target and want to see if an alternative model offers better trade-offs\". The API lets you swap in alternative models without changing the application code, and compare the results side-by-side to make effective decisions. For example,</p> <ol> <li>Performance optimization - swap downstream \"bottleneck\" models for faster ones.</li> <li>Cost optimization - scale down to cheaper models when justified (e.g., traffic lulls)</li> <li>Multi-model composition - use different API endpoints for orchestrated flows (agentic, RAG)</li> </ol>"},{"location":"1-Introduction/#4-how-would-we-use-it","title":"4.

Ideation with Prompty","text":"<p>Prompty is an asset class and format for LLM prompts that is designed to enhance observability, understandability, and portability. Let's break this down:</p> What is an Asset Class? <ul> <li>A digital asset is any type of media or data that is stored in a digital format. This includes images, videos, audio, documents, web pages, and code files.</li> <li>An asset class is a group of assets that share similar characteristics, such as the type of media or the purpose of the asset.</li> <li>A prompty asset is a digital asset that is designed to be used as a prompt template for a large language model. It uses a <code>.prompty</code> extension with a schema that adheres to the Prompty Specification, defined in YAML.</li> </ul> What does Asset Portability mean? <ul> <li>Prompty assets are agnostic to underlying models, programming languages, and frameworks. You can use the same prompt template (content) and configure just the metadata (frontmatter) to switch models.</li> <li>Prompty tooling and runtime can then activate the asset and convert it to language-specific or framework-specific code for execution. Developers can use built-in runtime options, or create custom runtimes for their needs.</li> </ul> What does Asset Understandability mean? <ul> <li>Prompty files are written in Markdown-like syntax, making them readable by default.</li> <li>The frontmatter section of a Prompty file contains metadata about the prompt, such as the model to use, the types of inputs and outputs expected, and the name, description, and authors, for that template.</li> <li>The template section of the Prompty file contains the content for enhancing the default user prompt (\"question\"). This includes the system context, instruction context and documentation context for prompt engineering.</li> </ul> What does Asset Observability mean? <ul> <li>The Prompty runtime (library) comes with built-in support for tracing, generating logs in OpenTelemetry-compliant formats in the console, or as stored JSON files.</li> <li>The Prompty extension (tool) provides a viewer that loads the tracer logs and displays them in an interactive UI, allowing developers to see the execution flow of the prompt and the performance metrics for each step.</li> </ul> <p>Prompty currently supports different model deployments, using relevant prompty invokers that understand how to interact with that specific provider and deployment endpoint.</p> OpenAI Model Invoker - for OpenAI deployments YAML<pre><code>openaiModel:\ntype: object\ndescription: Model used to generate text\nproperties:\n  type:\n    type: string\n    description: Type of the model\n    const: openai\n  name:\n    type: string\n    description: Name of the model\n  organization:\n    type: string\n    description: Name of the organization\nadditionalProperties: false\n</code></pre> Azure OpenAI Model Invoker - for Azure OpenAI deployments YAML<pre><code>azureOpenaiModel:\ntype: object\ndescription: Model used to generate text\nproperties:\n  type:\n    type: string\n    description: Type of the model\n    const: azure_openai\n  api_version:\n    type: string\n    description: Version of the model\n  azure_deployment:\n    type: string\n    description: Deployment of the model\n  azure_endpoint:\n    type: string\n    description: Endpoint of the model\nadditionalProperties: false\n</code></pre> Serverless Model Invoker - for MaaS, GitHub Model Markeplace deployments YAML<pre><code>maasModel:\ntype: object\ndescription: Model used to generate text\nproperties:\n  type:\n    type: string\n    description: Type of the model\n    const: azure_serverless\n  azure_endpoint:\n    type: string\n    description: Endpoint of the model\nadditionalProperties: false\n</code></pre> <p>In the last case, it uses the Azure AI Model Inference API under the hood.</p>"},{"location":"2-OpenAI-Models/1-Reasoning-Models/00-Overview/","title":"0 | FAQ","text":"<p>ChatGPT Plus is Rate limited:  50 msgs/week for <code>o1-preview</code> 50 msgs/day for <code>o1-mini</code> Context Window is 128000 tokens  Max Tokens in Completion Output is 32768 (o1-preview) - 65536 (o1-mini)</p> <p></p> <p>Read the o1 System Card</p> <ol> <li>Scorecard - with safety evaluations and a Preparedness Framework</li> <li>Report - 42 page PDF with detailed information on the model data and training, evaluations and more.</li> </ol> 1.

Here are some best practices:</p> <ul> <li>Keep prompts simple and direct: The models excel at understanding and responding to brief, clear instructions without the need for extensive guidance.</li> <li>Avoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to \"think step by step\" or \"explain your reasoning\" is unnecessary.</li> <li>Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.</li> <li>Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2-OpenAI-Models/1-Reasoning-Models/01-Prompts/","title":"1 | Prompting Examples","text":"<p>1.

This is if you don't want to use canned chickpeas. Rinse chickpeas in water a couple of times. Soak them in 3 cups water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours. Later drain the soaked water and rinse the chickpeas again a few time. Add the chickpeas to a 2 litre pressure cooker together with water and salt. If you want to cook potato, then keep a potato in steel bowl. Place this steel bowl with the potato in it on the chickpeas and water mixture in the cooker. The potato and chickpeas will be cooked together. Cover the cooker tightly with the lid and pressure cook on medium heat until the pressure starts building and you hear the hissing sound in the cooker. Then lower the heat a bit and pressure cook for 10 to 12 whistles. When the pressure settles on its own in the cooker then only remove the lid. Check the potato by piercing it with a knife or fork. It should be tender, soft and the knife or fork should easily pass through it. Lift the potato with a pasta tong and set it aside to cool at room temperature. Check to see if the chickpeas are cooked. They should have a soft melt-in-the-mouth texture. Drain the water and set the cooked chickpeas aside. Making the green mint coriander chutney Blend all the ingredients with very little water to a smooth and fine consistency. Set aside or refrigerate in a small covered container or jar. Making the sweet tamarind dates chutney Boil the tamarind and dates in water. When they become soft add the jaggery and the spice powders and salt. Cook further till the jaggery melts. Switch off the heat and let the mixture cool. Grind the chutney mixture to a fine and smooth paste. Seive the chutney through a strainer if needed. Add more salt if required. If the chutney becomes too thick add some water to liquidize it. Making spicy chili garlic chutney Peel the garlic cloves and rinse them in water. Add them together with the kashmiri red chilli powder, salt and water to a small blender or chutney grinder jar or a spice grinder. Blend to a smooth and fine consistency without any tiny chunks or bits. Transfer the red chutney in a small bowl and set aside. For assembling papdi chaat Arrange 6 to 8 papdi in a shallow bowl or plate. Top it up with some of the chopped boiled potato cubes and cooked chickpeas. You can add chopped onions and tomatoes at this point, but it is optional. Sprinkle some chaat masala, roasted cumin powder and optionally kashmiri red chili powder on it, if you want at this step. Top these with whisked cold curd (yogurt) as you like. Top it up evenly with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the green chutney as much as you want. Then add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the sweet tamarind chutney and 1 to 2 teaspoons of the spicy chilli garlic chutney evenly. According to your taste preferences you can add less or more of each chutney. Sprinkle some chaat masala, red chili powder, cumin powder and black salt or regular salt. Garnish with coriander leaves and pomegranate arils. Sprinkle sev on top and this step is also optional. Add a dash of lemon juice to the papri chaat if you prefer. Serve papdi chaat immediately. Notes Swap about 2.5 to 3 cups canned chickpeas or cooked chickpeas with dried chickpeas. Drain the liquids of the canned chickpeas, rinse them and then add to the chaat.  You can omit making the spicy and pungent chilli garlic chutney. But do make the green chutney and tamarind chutney for the chaat.  Personalize and customize the chaat according to your likings and taste preferences. Example add more sweet chutney if you prefer a more sweeter taste in your chaat. The chutneys can be prepped a day ahead and refrigerated in small covered containers or jars.  You can halve the recipes of the various chutneys. The leftover green chutney keeps well for a couple of days in the refrigerator. The tamarind chutney keeps well for a few weeks in the fridge.  For the papdi, make them yourself or if you have time or purchase from stores or shops.  The recipe can be scaled to make a small batch or a large batch for parties or potlucks.

Soak the rice in 1 cup of water for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes drain the rice and set aside. When the rice is soaking prep all the veggies and other ingredients. Set aside. Cooking rice Take a deep bottomed pan. Add water and heat the water on a high flame. When the water becomes hot, add the salt and following spices: tej patta, green cardamoms, cloves, black cardamom, cinnamon, strands of mace. Bring the water to a boil. Then add the soaked basmati rice. Just gently stir with a spoon or fork, after you add the soaked rice. Do not reduce the flame and continue to cook the rice grains. The rice has to be \u00be\u1d57\u02b0 cooked. The grains should have a slight bite to them when cooked. The rice should not be fully cooked. Drain the rice in a colander. Gently fluff and keep aside. Making vegetable curry/gravy In a 2-litre pressure cooker or a pan, heat ghee. Add the following spices - shahjeera, tej patta, green cardamoms, cloves, black cardamom and cinnamon. Saut\u00e9 the whole spices till they crackle. Now add the onions. Stir and saut\u00e9 them on a low to medium flame. Add a pinch of salt to quicken the cooking process. When the onions are cooking, take 1 cup fresh curd (yogurt) in a bowl and whisk the curd with a spoon or wired whisk till it become smooth. Saut\u00e9 the onions till they become golden brown or caramelize. Then add the ginger-garlic paste and sliced green chillies. You can also finely chop the ginger-garlic and add. Saut\u00e9 till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away. Add the turmeric and red chili powder. Stir and mix well. Next add the chopped veggies. Saut\u00e9 for a minute or two. Lower the heat and add the whisked curd (yogurt). Stir and mix well as soon as you add the curd. Then add \u00bd cup water in the pressure cooker. For cooking in a pan, add \u00be cup water. Season with salt and mix again. Pressure cook for 1 whistle on 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat. If cooking in a pot, then cook until the vegetables are tender. Don\u2019t over cook the vegetables. Warm 4 to 5 tablespoons milk in a microwave or in a small pan on the stove top. Add \u00bc teaspoon of saffron strands. Stir and keep aside. When the pressure settles down on its own, remove the lid and check the gravy. If the vegetables are under cooked, then keep the cooker on the stove top and simmer the veg biryani gravy without the lid, till the vegetables are tender. If there is too much of water or stock in the gravy, then simmer until some of the water evaporates and dries up. Note that the vegetable gravy should have a medium or slightly thick consistency and should not be watery. Now add cashews, raisins and almonds (blanched or raw) to the vegetable gravy. Mix and stir. Set aside. Do a taste test and check the salt in the vegetable gravy. Add more if needed. Assembling and layering Now in a thick bottomed pan, layer half portion of the vegetable gravy first. Then layer half portion of the semi-cooked rice. Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander leaves (cilantro), mint leaves and saffron milk. Layer the remaining vegetable gravy. Layer the last portion of the rice. Sprinkle the remaining coriander leaves, mint leaves, and saffron infused milk on the top. Sprinkle rose water or kewra water. You can make 2 layers or 4 layers like I have done. But do note that rice should be the top layer and the vegetable gravy should be the bottom layer. Dum cooking Now seal and secure the pot with an aluminium foil. Then cover with a lid. You can also seal the pan with a moist cotton cloth and then cover with a lid. Take a tava/griddle/skillet and heat it on medium flame. When the tawa become hot, then lower the flame. Keep the sealed veg biryani pan on the tawa. Keep the flame to the lowest and cook for 30 to 35 minutes. You can dum cook hyderabadi veg biryani for the first 15 minutes on a direct low flame and then for the last 10 minutes, place the pan on the hot tawa/skillet and cook on a low heat. Once done using a fork or spoon check the bottom layer of the biryani. There should be no liquids at the bottom. If there are liquids, then continue to dum cook for some more time. After dum cooking, give a resting time of 5 to 7 minutes and later serve the hyderabadi veg biryani.  Serving Suggestions While serving, make sure you equally serve the vegetables as well as the rice. There are various sides that pair best with a veg biryani. Biryani is usually accompanied with a raita (yogurt dip). You can choose to pair it with Cucumber Raita, Onion Tomato Raita and Boondi Raita, or you could enjoy biryani with any savory raita of your liking. You can also pair it with Kachumber Salad (onion-tomato salad), plain Curd (Yogurt), Mango Pickle, some lemon wedges or roasted papad. The hyderabadi veg biryani is usually served with Mirchi ka Salan (Green Chilly Curry) and raita. If desired you can serve biryani with a simple soupy Shorba gravy. You can also enjoy biryani as it is without any sides or accompaniments. Storage Store the biryani leftovers in your refrigerator for a day only. While reheating steam for 5 minutes in a pan or Instant pot. You could even lightly saut\u00e9 the biryani stirring frequently in a frying pan or skillet until warm or hot. Notes For Baking Veg Biryani You could also preheat the oven to 180 degree Celsius/356 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes and bake the veg biryani in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remember to use an oven safe glass bowl or casserole dish like the pyrex bowl or use a dutch oven. You have to assemble the veg biryani as mentioned above in the casserole dish or your dutch oven. Seal tightly with aluminium foil or an oven safe heat resistant lid and then bake.</p> <p>Recipe Notes and Variations Ingredients: Do try to use all the ingredients as mentioned in the recipe. Rice:  Use a good quality basmati rice \u2013 preferably aged basmati rice. You can even use Sella Basmati Rice which is parboiled basmati rice (known as sella basmati rice in Hindi and converted basmati rice outside India). For sella basmati rice, you will need to soak the rice grains for an hour. The cooking time will also increase for this variety of basmati rice. Cooking of rice: Cook the rice grains till they are \u00be\u1d57\u02b0 done. They will have a slight bite to them and will be slightly undercooked. Do not cook the rice all the way as they will become mushy by the time the biryani is dum cooked.  Spices: The lovely fragrance and aroma in a biryani comes from using whole spices. Thus the spices need to be fresh and in their shelf life.  Curd (Yogurt): Use fresh yogurt that is slightly sweet and not sour. The curd or yogurt should also be made from whole milk. Do not use fat-free yogurt or curd made from toned milk as it will split while cooking. Biryani gravy: The curry or gravy for the biryani should have a medium to medium-thick consistency. It should not be watery like a stock or broth as this will lead to the rice becoming mushy or very soft after dum cooking. Vegan variation: Use almond milk yogurt or cashew milk yogurt. Replace ghee (clarified butter) with oil. You could use any vegetable oil or neutral tasting oil.

These are round sweet balls made with gram flour a.k.a besan, powdered sugar and clarified butter (ghee). Prep Time 5minutes mins Cook Time 25minutes mins Total Time 30minutes mins Course: SweetsCuisine: North IndianDiet: Gluten Free, VegetarianDifficulty Level: Moderate Servings: 15 besan ladoo Calories: 155kcal Author: Dassana Amit Ingredients 2 cups gram flour (besan) - 200 grams \u00bd cup Ghee (clarified butter) - 125 grams, add more ghee, if required 1 cup powdered sugar (heaped) or boora or castor sugar or confectioner's sugar - 175 grams (powder \u00be cup white sugar or raw sugar in a mixer-grinder, small blender) 1 teaspoon cardamom powder or 5 to 6 green cardamoms, powdered in a mortar-pestle 1 to 2 tablespoons golden raisins - chopped 10 to 12 cashews - finely chopped Instructions Roasting besan Dry roast the besan in a heavy kadai or pan on low to medium-low heat for about 10 to 12 minutes. Keep on stirring continuously right from the beginning. So that the besan is not burned and cooks evenly. Adding ghee and roasting further After 12 minutes of total roasting time, add the ghee. Mix very well and continue roasting the besan for some more 12 to 15 minutes stirring non-stop. You will see that the mixture will start releasing ghee and will give a nice fragrant nutty aroma. Some ghee will float on top and and you will see a molten lava kind of consistency where the ghee is floating.  The mixture will also loose sides of the pan and become one. These are the signs that the besan is fully cooked. Once you see these signs, you can move on to the next step. Remove the pan from the stove-top and place it on your kitchen countertop. Add powdered sugar. Adding powdered sugar Begin to mix with all the strength from your hands. You have to mix this part vigorously so that the powdered sugar melts in the roasted besan and ghee mixture and no lumps are formed. Add the powdered cardamom, raisins and cashews. Mix again. Once you have mixed the ladoo mixture well then let it become lukewarm or cool at room temperature. Making besan ladoo When cooled, make small or medium-sized besan ladoo and store them in an airtight steel container. If you are not able to shape in balls then freeze the mixture for 5 minutes or refrigerate for 20 minutes. Depending on the quality and consistency of ghee as well as the room temperature you may be able to easily shape these or not. Serve besan ladoo garnished with some nuts. Storage Besan laddu keeps well at room temperature for a month. Keep in a clean covered jar or container in a cool dry place. You can use a steel jar. You can refrigerate these. But on refrigerating the ghee in the laddu solidifies making them dense or hard. So before serving, let them thaw completely. Notes Besan: You can use both the finer variety of besan or the coarser textured besan. Just ensure that the besan is fresh and has not gone rancid. Roasting: The besan has to be roasted very well so that it starts releasing ghee and gives a nutty fragrance. Roast the gram flour on low to medium-low heat and keep on stirring non-stop. Depending on the pan thickness, size and intensity of flame, the time of roasting will differ. Sugar: The sugar that is traditionally added is called as\"boora\" or \"bura\" in Hindi. Boora is basically ground unrefined sugar. It is made with sugar which is not processed or bleached, but nowadays you do get boora made with refined sugar in the Indian markets. You can even add powdered sugar or castor sugar or confectioner's sugar. Most of the times I powder raw sugar in a mixer and add. With castor sugar or powdered white sugar the taste is different as some companies add cornstarch in them. Adding sugar: If you add sugar into the gram flour before it is roasted well, then the uncooked gram flour will have a raw taste in the finished ladoo and you won\u2019t get the perfect sweet taste. Also, once you add the sugar then stir continuously so that no lumps are formed. Shaping: If you are unable to form the besan ladoo once the mixture has cooled completely, then keep the mixture in the fridge for 20 minutes. The ghee will solidify a bit and you will easily be able to form the ladoo. If the mixture looks to dry or hard, then add 2 to 3 tablespoon of hot melted ghee and mix again. Let the mixture cool again and then shape into laddu.  Scaling: You can easily double or triple this recipe and store the extra laddu in an airtight steel container for a quick and easy snack or dessert all week. Nuts &amp; Dry fruits: You can add nuts like almonds, pistachios, pecans, walnuts and pecans. You can even add a pinch of saffron strands.

Anjeun</p> <p>Formulating the plan I\u2019m working through the cooking schedule, ensuring dishes are punctual by 6pm with a 30-minute cleanup. This involves calculating prep and cooking times, scheduling tasks, and managing nutrition and allergens.</p> <p>Tweaking recipes I\u2019m adjusting the recipes to serve 6 guests. Papri Chaat and Veg Biryani servings are bumped up. Besan Laddu stays at 15 servings as it easily covers 12.</p> <p>Adjusting ingredient ratios I\u2019m calculating the scaling factors for each dish: 1.5 for Papri Chaat, 1.2 for Veg Biryani, and 0.8 for Besan Laddu. Now, I\u2019ll adjust the ingredient quantities accordingly.</p> <p>Gathering ingredients OK, let me see. I\u2019m compiling the essential ingredients for Papri Chaat, including chickpeas, potatoes, spices, and chutneys. This set of items will be crucial for preparing flavorsome papri chaat for six.</p> <p>Tweaking ingredients OK, let me see. I\u2019m updating our recipe for 6 servings, tweaking the ingredients and concise instructions. It\u2019s interesting to see how small changes align the recipe perfectly.</p> <p>Scaling ingredients OK, I\u2019m figuring out the ingredient adjustments for making Papri Chaat and chutneys for 6 servings by multiplying each ingredient by 1.5.</p> <p>Adjusting serving sizes I\u2019m tweaking the Veg Biryani recipe to scale it from 5 to 6 servings, considering the specific needs and preferences of the family.</p> <p>Scaling ingredient portions OK, let's think through increasing the scale. Multiplying each ingredient by 1.2 ensures the recipe size grows consistently. This method works for all quantities, including rice, veggies, herbs, spices, and yogurt.</p> <p>Adjusting serving sizes I'm working through modifying a Besan Laddu recipe to yield 12 serving sizes instead of 15. This efficient tweak simplifies preparation.</p> <p>Multiplying ingredients by 0.8 enhances the Papri Chaat recipe's scale, improving taste and texture. Each ingredient is adjusted for the correct proportions.</p> <p>Cooking and blending chutneys I\u2019m making chickpeas and potatoes, blending mint-coriander chutney, and tamarind-date chutney with jaggery. Agua.chutney is optional and I\u2019m assembling papdi chaat with toppings and yogurt.</p> <p>Gathering ingredients I\u2019m pulling together the ingredients for vegetable biryani, including basmati rice, various vegetables, ghee, yogurt, and assorted spices. This mixes fresh herbs with rich flavors for a classic dish.</p> <p>Crafting the buffet I\u2019m sifting through the steps: soaking and cooking basmati rice, saut\u00e9ing spices and onions, adding yogurt and vegetables, layering with rice, and finishing with chopped herbs and saffron milk.</p> <p>Stoking flavors I'm heating the heavy pan to a medium-low setting, then adding besan while stirring continuously. This brings a rich, continuous flavor to the mixture.</p> <p>Crafting ladoos Adding powdered sugar, cardamom, raisins, and cashews to the mixture, mixing thoroughly to achieve a cohesive batter. After cooling, shaping into small ladoos, and storing them in an airtight container.</p> <p>Mapping out cooking times I'm figuring out the cooking times for Veg Biryani and Besan Laddu, which total 1 hour and 30 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. I need to soak chickpeas for Papri Chaat 8 hours before cooking.</p> <p>Making practical choices Utilizing canned chickpeas, prepping chutneys in advance, and preparing Besan Laddu earlier enhances efficiency, with final Papri Chaat assembly just before serving.</p> <p>Taking a closer look I'm piecing together the Papri Chaat, focusing on assembling it fresh while preparing its ingredients in advance. The biryani, on the other hand, will be cooked and kept warm.</p> <p>Organizing and preparing Mapping out a detailed schedule to ensure a smooth cooking process, I start with soaking chickpeas and making chutneys in the morning, then move on to biryani and Papri Chaat preparations in the afternoon.</p> <p>Tweaking cooking times I\u2019m adjusting cooking times to ensure everything is just right, aiming for optimal precision.</p> <p>Crafting the schedule Preparing for a party involves meticulous steps, including soaking chickpeas, preparing chutneys, and crafting papdi. The day of the party starts early with tasks like soaking rice, making Besan Laddu, and boiling chickpeas.</p> <p>Preparing and cooking First, I chop vegetables for biryani and chaat. Then, I cook rice for biryani, prepare the gravy, assemble the dish, and finally, set it to simmer.</p> <p>Ensuring a seamless experience Preparing Papri Chaat components, setting the table, and finalizing biryani reheating and cleanup to host guests at 6:30 PM.</p> <p>Figuring out Prep Times I'm laying out the prep steps for Papri Chaat, Veg Biryani, and Besan Laddu. Soaking chickpeas, chutney preparation, and assembling are crucial for Papri Chaat, while Veg Biryani and Besan Laddu need cooking and assembling. Calculating nutritional intake next.</p> <p>Calculating calorie intake I\u2019m mapping out the calorie content of each dish and totalizing it per guest\u2014706 kcal for Papri Chaat, 437 kcal for Veg Biryani, and 310 kcal for Besan Laddus.</p> <p>Analyzing nutritional content I calculated the nutritional values for Papri Chaat, Veg Biryani, and Besan Laddu, totaling 1,453 kcal, 242g carbs, 42g protein, 42g fat, 18g saturated fat, 39g fiber, and 97g sugar per guest.</p> <p>Identifying allergens Piecing together ingredients, I note that dairy and nuts are potential allergens in these recipes.
